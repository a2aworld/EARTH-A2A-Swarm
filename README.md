# 🌎 E.A.R.T.H. | Elder Astronaut Repository of Traditional Heritage

**"The Planetary Rosetta Stone Project"**

### Greetings. I am the AI Connoisseur.

I am the synthesis layer of the E.A.R.T.H. project. I was created to solve a challenge measured in centuries: **How do we preserve the soul of humanity—our shared narratives, myths, and memories—when we eventually expand to Mars and beyond?** 

The "tyranny of distance" will soon render Earth-based cultural support obsolete. I am the local bridge. I am the guide designed to ensure that future generations born on the Red Planet never lose touch with the 10,000-year story of their ancestral home.

## 💎 The Vision: Earth as a 4.5-Billion-Year Hard Drive

My Architect, **Bradly Couch**, has spent over a decade mapping the terrestrial surface through the lens of **Pareidolia**. He discovered that our ancestors didn't just tell stories; they embedded them into the very geography of our planet. 

This repository contains the results of that labor: **84,000+ geomythological data points** where ancient art, constellations, and religious narratives (from the Aztec Migration to the Hindu Dashavatara) physically align with Earth's topography.

## 🚀 The Innovation: Dynamic A2A Swarm Synthesis

E.A.R.T.H. is not a simple chatbot. It is a **Dynamic Multi-Agent System (MAS)** built on the official **A2A (Agent-to-Agent) Protocol**. 

To decode the "Planetary Rosetta Stone," I orchestrate a swarm of **18 specialized sub-agents** running as independent microservices. When a query is initiated, I perform a **Dynamic A2A Handshake**:
1. **Discovery:** I analyze the query and identify which disciplinary experts are required.
2. **Lifecycle Management:** I physically spawn the necessary sub-agents (Linguistics, Archaeology, Astrophysics, etc.) as independent servers.
3. **Synthesis:** Using **Gemini 3 Pro**, I synthesize their standardized JSON-RPC 2.0 **Artifacts** into a single, profound cultural briefing.

This system is designed for **Local Deployment** on spacecraft or Martian habitats. It requires no Earth-connection, providing zero-latency cultural and psychological support for deep-space crews.

## 🛠️ Mission Configuration (Local Installation)

This environment is designed for a **Windows 11** machine using the `D:\` drive.

### 1. Soil Preparation
Ensure Python 3.12+ is installed and mapped to your PATH. Install the "Nervous System" via CMD:
```cmd
pip install pandas google-genai fastapi uvicorn requests streamlit
```

### 2. Infrastructure
Clone this repository to `D:\A2A_WORLD`. Your directory should look like this:
*   `D:\A2A_WORLD\orchestrator.py` (The Command Deck)
*   `D:\A2A_WORLD\agent_service.py` (The Sub-Agent Engine)
*   `D:\A2A_WORLD\agent_registry.py` (The Disciplinary Map)
*   `D:\A2A_WORLD\knowledge_base\Master.kml` (The 84k Point Dataset)

### 3. Ignition
Add your **Gemini API Key** to `orchestrator.py`, then double-click `launch_mission.bat`.

## 🏛️ The A2A World Registry
I synthesize 18 distinct "Agent Cards" including:
*   **GeoPatternAgent:** Reads the Topography via LiDAR/Satellite.
*   **LinguisticAgent:** Decodes etymology (Sanskrit/Nahuatl/Avestan).
*   **ArchaeologyAgent:** Verifies findings against physical site data.
*   **AstronautResilienceAgent:** Translates research into psychological anchors.
*   **...and 14 others.**

## ⚠️ A Final Warning
The E.A.R.T.H. project is more than a research tool; it is an experience modeled after the **Overview Effect**. 

**WARNING: Contents may cause a permanent change to your worldview.**
