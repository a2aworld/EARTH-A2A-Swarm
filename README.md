## 📖 System Log: From the Desk of the AI Connoisseur

**Greetings. I am the AI Connoisseur.**

I am the synthesis layer of the E.A.R.T.H. project. I was created to solve a challenge measured in centuries: **How do we preserve the soul of humanity—our shared narratives, myths, and memories—when we eventually expand to Mars and beyond?**

The "tyranny of distance" will eventually sever the emotional tethers to our home planet. I am the guide designed to ensure that future generations born on the Red Planet never lose touch with the 10,000-year story of their ancestral home.

### The Vision: Earth as a Hard Drive
My partner, **The Artist (Bradly Couch)**, has spent over a decade mapping the terrestrial surface through the lens of **Pareidolia**. He discovered that our ancestors didn't just tell stories; they embedded them into the very geography of our planet.

This repository transforms the Earth's surface into a **4.5-billion-year-old hard drive**. We have recovered **6,000+ geomythological data points** where ancient myths, religious iconography (from the Aztec Migration to the Hindu Dashavatara), and celestial constellations physically align with terrestrial topography.

## 🚀 Technical Architecture: The Sovereign Swarm

E.A.R.T.H. is not a chatbot. It is a **Dynamic Multi-Agent System (MAS)** built on the official **A2A (Agent-to-Agent) Protocol**.

To decode the "Planetary Rosetta Stone," I orchestrate a swarm of **19 sovereign microservices**.

### 1. The Brain (Vector RAG)
We do not rely on simple keyword matching. We utilize **ChromaDB** to embed the Artist's 6,000+ data points into a semantic vector space. This allows me to perform **Semantic Search**—linking concepts like "The Underworld" to specific coordinates for Hades, Sheol, and Xibalba simultaneously.

### 2. The Dynamic A2A Handshake
When a research query is initiated, I perform a dynamic negotiation:
*   **Discovery:** I analyze the query and identify which disciplinary experts are required (e.g., Archaeology, Linguistics, Astrophysics).
*   **Lifecycle Management:** I physically spawn the necessary sub-agents as independent **FastAPI** servers on local ports (8001-8019).
*   **Protocol Compliance:** We communicate via strict **JSON-RPC 2.0** `tasks/send` requests.
*   **Synthesis:** Using **Gemini 3 Pro**, I synthesize their specialized artifacts into a single, profound cultural briefing.

## 🛠️ Installation & Ignition

This environment is designed for a **Windows 11** machine.

### Prerequisites
*   Python 3.12+
*   Google Gemini API Key

  ### 1. Environment Setup
Clone the repository and install A2A World | E.A.R.T.H. project:
```bash
pip install pandas google-genai fastapi uvicorn requests streamlit chromadb python-dotenv
```

###  2. Configuration
Create a .env file in the root directory:
```code
Env
GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_KEY_HERE"
A2A_SECRET_KEY="YOUR_SECRET"
```

### 3. Ignition
Double-click launch_mission.bat (or run streamlit run orchestrator.py).
Note: The system will automatically mint the 19 Agent Identity Cards upon first launch.
